# Avneet Kaur's Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website created for my COMP2068 - JavaScript Frameworks assignment at Georgian College. The site showcases a bit about me, my projects, and how to contact me. I have used Node.js, Express, and Handlebars (HBS) for building this web application.
